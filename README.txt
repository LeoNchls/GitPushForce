TL;DR: Try better_slots and laivan_upotus and have a look at the other files :)

This is my personal projects repo. Only the python projects and "fizzbuzz_cpp" function as stand-alone programs. This is because the other projects were created with others, and I didn't want to share their code without their permission.

However, just because they don't function as programs doesn't mean that they have no function! The projects "sisu_project" and "minesweeper_gui" are meant to represent my programming style and show what features of each language I've used. For example, the sisu project demonstrates my use of the gson library for reading json text files into data structures, and minesweeper_gui demonstrates my use of the Qt UI library.

I recommend trying better_slots, because I find it the most entertaining out of all of my projects. Laivan_upotus is also interesting, being a classic battle ship game. Try them out! Sisu_project is my most recent project, and it was made in co-operation with other students, so I've only shared the parts I made myself. It also contains the tests I wrote for the program, which may be interesting to look at.
