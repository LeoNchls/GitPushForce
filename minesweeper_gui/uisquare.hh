/* UISquare class for a Qt minesweeper GUI
 *
 * desc:
 * A class that represents squares in a minesweeper board. They can be opened,
 * flagged, or questioned. Flags and question serve basically the same purpose
 * except they are marked differently. The program using these squares decides
 * what to do with the question marks.
 *
 * Squares with flags or question marks can't be opened before first removing
 * the mark.
 *
 * Program author
 * Name:            Leo M
 *
 * Notes about the program and it's implementation:
 * - The squares consist of a QPushButton and a QLabel. The labels are only
 *   only used to block buttons from being pushed at inappropriate times.
 *   The reason this approach was used is that disabling QPushButtons also
 *   greys them out. This could potentially be subverted using stylesheets
 *   but in the scope of this course the label approach was more appropriate
 *   |
 *   â””- The labels could be removed and the only drawback would be that the
 *      buttons would change their shade when the cursor is hovering over
 *      them. Functionally the labels serve no purpose.
